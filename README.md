# Ionix Framework
(Name may change)

Ionix was my try to escape from boring days when I was forced to study for the exams.<br/>
It is a MVC framework heavily inspired by Laravel, a framework that I love (see laravel.com), built in PHP 5.4+ that aims to be fast and very light for simple projects.

For the near future I plan to:

- add new components but keeping the ideea of simplicity
- incapsulate the framework in composer package
- add unit tests for the whole components
- refactor current components
- documenting the features
- port the framework to Node JS
